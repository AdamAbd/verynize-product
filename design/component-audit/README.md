# Components, instances and slots (page shell / app shell): audit and phase 1 spec

Research, 2026-11-06:

- [figma/README.md](figma/README.md): live Figma capture. Native **Slot** properties were proven: a slot holds ordinary layers per instance, and that content survives edits to the main ([17](figma/17-different-slot-content.png) → [18](figma/18-header-update-preserves-slots.png)). Detach turns a slot into a plain frame and keeps its content ([30](figma/30-detached.png)).
- [pen/README.md](pen/README.md): Pen, captured live plus Pen's own schema. A main component is a node with `reusable`. An instance is a `ref` whose `descendants` is a flat override map keyed by id path. A slot is `Frame.slot`, and an instance replaces the slot's subtree with its own content.
- [verynize/README.md](verynize/README.md): what Verynize has today. A library kept in localStorage that copies nodes. "Update instances" replaces each whole subtree, so edits made in an instance are lost. There is no main/instance link on the canvas, and no detach, reset or slots.

The code audit recommends **materialized instances**: an instance is made of real nodes on the page. Hit testing, selection, cloud per-key operations, lazy pages, export and agent tools all assume every node is a real node with its own id, so render-time expansion would have to be threaded through every one of them.

## Phase 1 scope

In scope: main components, instances, overrides per property, slots (default and modified), detach, reset overrides, go to main component, a Components panel with an **App shell** preset, MCP/agent tools, layers and inspector and canvas indicators, and tests.

Deferred to phase 2: variants and component sets, component properties (text, boolean, instance swap), slot minimum and maximum counts and preferred instances, cross-file libraries, pushing overrides to the main, and migrating the old `libraryComponent` library. The old library keeps working unchanged.

## Data model (stored on ordinary nodes, schema in `web/document-core.js`)

| Field                                | On                                                       | Meaning                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `component: true`                    | a frame                                                  | This frame is a **main component**. It can be on any page, nested or top-level. |
| `instanceOf: "<main id>"`            | instance root (frame)                                    | The main this instance follows.                                                 |
| `sourceId: "<main node id>"`         | every linked node inside an instance, including its root | The node in the main that this node copies.                                     |
| `overrides: string[]`                | any linked node                                          | Keys this node owns locally; the sync never writes them.                        |
| `slot: true` (+ optional `slotName`) | a frame that is a descendant of a main                   | A content region.                                                               |

### Rules

- **Always local, never synced:** `id`, `parentId` of the instance root, `x`/`y` of the instance root, and the link fields themselves.
- **Synced:** every other key of a linked node is copied from its source unless it is listed in `overrides`. That includes `w`/`h` and `name`; editing them in the instance makes them overrides.
- **Marking overrides.** A shared, pure `syncComponents(prev, next)` runs at one central point before every render and save, and in the headless transact.
  - It diffs `prev` against `next`.
  - A changed key on a linked node becomes an override, but only when its new value differs from the source's value.
  - A changed key on a main or a main descendant is propagated to every linked node that has not overridden it.
- **The sync must be deterministic and idempotent.** Two clients that apply the same operations reach the same document, and running the sync twice changes nothing.
- **Changes to the main's structure.**
  - A child added to the main is added to every instance.
  - A child removed from the main is removed from instances.
  - A child reordered in the main is reordered in instances.
  - Ids of materialized nodes are derived stably from (instance root id, source id), so every client produces the same ids.
- **Inside an instance, outside any slot.**
  - Deleting an inherited node hides it (an override of the existing visibility key) rather than unlinking it.
  - A node added there is local: it has no `sourceId`, and the sync keeps it.
- **Slots.**
  - **Default state:** the slot frame in the instance follows its source, and its children follow the main slot's default children.
  - **Modified state:** as soon as a child of the instance's slot is added, removed, reordered or edited, `"children"` is added to that slot frame's `overrides`. From then on its children are local and are never synced or removed.
  - The slot frame's own properties (size, layout, fill…) keep syncing unless they are overridden.
  - Reset on the slot returns it to Default.
- **Nested instances.**
  - A main may contain instances of other mains. The sync runs in dependency order, inner mains first.
  - A main may not contain an instance of itself, directly or indirectly. Validation and the UI both reject such a cycle.
- **Detach.**
  - Remove `instanceOf`, `sourceId` and `overrides` from the nodes linked to the detached main.
  - A nested instance inside stays an instance of its own main. Its nodes are re-pointed: `sourceId` becomes the `sourceId` of the source node they referred to.
  - Slot frames become plain frames and keep their children.
- **Reset overrides:** clear `overrides` on the selected node, or on every node in the instance, then re-sync.
- **Duplicate, copy and paste.**
  - Duplicating or pasting a **main** creates an **instance** of it, as in Figma.
  - Duplicating an instance creates an instance that keeps its overrides and slot content.
- **Deleted or missing main.**
  - Instances keep their links and keep rendering their last state.
  - The inspector says the main component is missing and offers Detach.
  - The sync skips them. Undo brings the main back.
- **Undo:** the changes the sync makes belong to the same undo step as the edit that caused them.
- **Validation:**
  - Only types are checked: strings, a boolean, an array of strings, and `slot` allowed only on frames.
  - A dangling `instanceOf` is **not** an error, because of lazy cloud pages and partial documents.
  - `documentSafety` must never reject a document because of these links.

## UI

- **Commands, listed in `canvas-interactions.js` and shown in the context menu, command palette and shortcuts drawer:**
  - Create component (`⌥⌘K`): for one frame; for several layers it first wraps them in a frame.
  - Create instance.
  - Go to main component.
  - Reset overrides.
  - Detach instance (`⌥⌘B`).
  - Convert to slot / Remove slot (for frames inside a main).
- **Layers panel icons:** a filled four-diamond for a main, a hollow diamond for an instance, a square-plus for a slot. Mains and instances use the component purple color token, slots the slot pink token. Inherited instance children show a muted purple label, and local slot children a normal label.
- **Canvas:**
  - Selection outline and name label in component purple for mains and instances; a dashed outline for an instance.
  - A pink outline for a selected slot, and a "+" affordance on an empty slot.
- **Inspector, new Component section.**
  - On a main: its name, "Create instance", the instance count, and the list of its slots.
  - On an instance: the main's name (click it to go to the main), Reset overrides (with a count), Detach, and each slot with a **Default** or **Modified** badge.
- **Components panel (left sidebar):**
  - Lists every main in the document, with search; click or drag inserts an instance.
  - An **App shell** preset creates a main component "App Shell": a header (title and nav), a sidebar (items), and a `Content` slot, built with auto layout and design tokens.
- Colors are tokens in `web/src/styles/globals.css`, never raw values. Icon-only buttons have an `aria-label`.

## Agents (MCP)

- `design-tools.mjs` `nodeFields` accepts the new fields.
- New tools: `create_component`, `create_instance`, `detach_instance`, `reset_overrides`, `set_slot`.
- The JSX codec writes `data-component`, `data-instance-of` and `data-slot` attributes so agents can see instances and slots.
- Headless edits run the same shared sync.

## Implementation notes (phase A: core engine)

The engine is `web/component-core.js` (`window.VerynizeComponents`; Node: `integrations/component-core.mjs`). Its tests are `integrations/component-core.test.mjs` and `tests/components.cjs`. Where the code differs from or sharpens the rules above:

- **`syncComponents(prev, next)` mutates `next` in place and returns it.** The canvas and its gestures hold references to node objects, so nodes are updated, not replaced. `prev` is only read.
- **Where overrides are marked.**
  - The canvas marks the in-place edits made between two renders. `render()` syncs first and diffs against the previous sync's result, ignoring the geometry the canvas measures while drawing.
  - Only the instances and mains an edit touched are checked and re-synced. A render costs about one comparison per layer inside mains and instances: 1–4 ms for an app shell with ten instances, about 20 ms at 5,000 instance layers.
  - A replaced document is only reconciled, never marked. That covers `setDocument`/`loadDocument`, undo, remote operations and agent commits.
  - Agent edits are marked headless, before they reach the canvas: in `design-tools.mjs` `write()` and in `design-store.mjs` `applyOperations`.
  - So other `setDocument` callers that edit instance layers (imports, the old library's "Update instances") are reconciled back to the main rather than marked.
- **Measured geometry is neither marked nor copied**, except when a node is first materialized. That is `w`/`h` under hug, fill or percent sizing, and `x`/`y`/`w`/`h` of constraint-anchored layers. The canvas computes them for each instance; `inset` and the sizing modes themselves do sync.
- **`parentId` of an inherited layer is not an override.**
  - With history, moving an inherited layer out of its place snaps it back. Reordering inherited layers outside a slot snaps back too.
  - Without history, the moved copy becomes a plain layer and the instance gets its layer back.
  - Inside a slot, any move makes the slot Modified, as specified.
- **Instance ownership.** The root's `sourceId` is its main's id. A nested instance copied inside another instance has `sourceId` = the node it copies (≠ `instanceOf`), so it belongs to the outer instance; a node belongs to the nearest root whose `sourceId === instanceOf`. Detach, and a slot turning Modified, re-point such nested copies one level down, keeping the overrides of both levels.
- **Derived ids** are `<instance root id, first 80 characters>~<106-bit hash of (root id, source id)>`. A taken id gets a salted next attempt, deterministically.
- **Slots.**
  - On Modified, the layers in the slot lose their link fields and become local; nested instances in it are re-pointed.
  - Reset to Default removes the local content and re-materializes the main's.
  - In a merge where a slot ends up Default but holds local layers, the layers are removed: reset wins.
- **Cycles are not rejected by `validateDocument`.** This deviates from "Validation … reject such a cycle", because `documentSafety` must never reject a stored document.
  - The sync never touches a main that contains itself, and `componentProblems()` reports it.
  - `createInstance` and agent writes in `design-tools.mjs` refuse to create a new cycle.
- **Validation.**
  - Limits: `instanceOf` and `sourceId` are 1–200 characters; `overrides` has at most 500 keys of at most 120 characters; `slotName` has at most 100 characters.
  - Load-time repair (`normalizeDocument` with `repairs`) drops mistyped link fields and `slot` on non-frames, and records each drop.
- **Deleting an inherited layer** restores it hidden, together with its linked descendants. Local layers that were inside it stay deleted.
- **A same-step edit of the main and the instance on one key** makes the instance's value an override (the instance wins).
- **`component` on a node copied into an instance is removed**: a nested main is not a main inside instances. `createComponent` refuses instance roots and inherited layers.
- **Copies (`adoptCopies`).**
  - A copy of a main becomes an instance only when that main is in the document. A cut-then-paste of a main, or a main pasted from another file, stays a main.
  - A copied part of an instance becomes plain layers.
  - The "Name 2" renaming of a duplicate is reverted to the main's name by the next sync, because a new node has no overrides.
- **Agents (phase B2):** see "Component tools" in `docs/agent-workflows.md`.
  - `duplicateElements` calls `adoptCopies`; what the call changes on an instance root (label, classes) becomes an override.
  - The JSX codec writes and reads the link attributes. A new instance element is materialized from its main, and only its `data-slot` descendants are read (as slot content). Overrides outside slots are not carried by JSX: a whole-page JSX round trip keeps mains, instances and slot content, not other instance edits.
  - The lossless HTML export leaves the link fields out, so an exported instance imports as plain layers.
