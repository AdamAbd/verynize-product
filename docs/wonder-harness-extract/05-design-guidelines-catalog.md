# get_design_guidelines: tool schema and style catalog

Captured live 2026-10-30 (Wonder 0.2.190) by having the Wonder app agent call the tools; schemas come from the `deferred_tools_record` attachment in that session transcript.

## Result of `get_design_guidelines {}` (no style)

There is no separate catalog result: with no `style` the tool returns only the Design Fundamentals, byte-identical to `01-design-fundamentals.md` (13067 chars). The style list exists only in the tool description above.

With a `style`, the result is the same fundamentals text, then `\n\n---\n\n`, then that style's section. The style sections are in `06-design-styles/<slug>.md`.

## Styles (31)

The slug list is verbatim from the tool description. Title and first line are taken from each style's own section; the server sends no separate description per style.

| Slug | Title in guideline | First line | Section chars |
|---|---|---|---|
| `academia` | Academia / Classical | A physical university library rendered on screen: aged parchment, dark mahogany, polished brass and crimson leather, set in traditional book typography with measured ornament. | 3401 |
| `art-deco` | Art Deco | The Roaring Twenties as an interface: Gatsby opulence with skyscraper geometry. | 4002 |
| `bauhaus` | Bauhaus | A 1920s Bauhaus poster as an interface: every element composed from circles, squares and triangles, thick deliberate borders, pure primaries on stark black and white. | 3675 |
| `bold-typography` | Bold Typography | Poster design translated to the web: type is the whole visual language. | 2970 |
| `botanical` | Botanical / Organic Serif | A botanical garden, a ceramics studio and an editorial spread in one: soft, tactile, artisanal, the calm of high-end wellness and sustainable luxury. | 2656 |
| `claymorphism` | Claymorphism | A world made of premium digital clay: matte vinyl-toy surfaces that absorb light, dense and squeezable, floating with weight over a cool lavender ground. | 3768 |
| `cyberpunk` | Cyberpunk / Glitch | "High-tech, low-life": a hacked feed on a malfunctioning CRT in a rain-soaked megacity. | 4595 |
| `enterprise` | Corporate Trust | Modern enterprise SaaS that feels approachable rather than cold, in the manner of the tech unicorns that humanized corporate software. | 3532 |
| `flat-design` | Flat Design | Confident reduction: no shadows, bevels, realistic gradients or textures, so hierarchy comes entirely from size, color and type. | 2736 |
| `glassmorphism` | Glassmorphism | Depth through layered translucency: frosted surfaces that filter saturated color beneath them, like macOS Control Center or a dashboard floating in space. | 4324 |
| `industrial` | Industrial Skeuomorphism | An interface that feels like a machine: Dieter Rams clarity with Teenage Engineering playfulness. | 5145 |
| `kinetic` | Kinetic Typography | Typography is the entire structure: text becomes image and the headline is the hero. | 3163 |
| `luxury` | Luxury / Editorial | A high-end fashion magazine or a luxury house website (Vogue, Kinfolk, Aesop): exquisite type at dramatic scale, more negative space than feels comfortable, and intentional asymmetry that keeps architectural balance. | 3304 |
| `material-design` | Material You | Material You (Material Design 3): an organic, expressive system where tonal palettes from one seed color replace stark white, blurred organic shapes replace flat geometry, and pill buttons define the silhouette. | 3303 |
| `maximalism` | Maximalism / Dopamine | More is more: sensory abundance, clashing patterns, screaming color and joyful overlap, a Lisa Frank fever dream crossed with hyperpop album art. | 4662 |
| `minimal-dark` | Minimalist Dark | Atmospheric depth from layers of darkness, with warm amber glowing like embers: the visual language of premium dark-mode tools such as Linear, Raycast and Vercel. | 4003 |
| `modern-dark` | Modern Dark | Premium developer tools (Linear, Vercel, Raycast): obsessively crafted, nearly monochrome, every surface in three-dimensional space under soft ambient light, with one saturated indigo accent. | 5253 |
| `monochrome` | Minimalist Monochrome | Reduction to essence: black, white and typography, in the manner of fashion editorials, architectural monographs and museum catalogues (Chanel, Celine, Bottega Veneta). | 3711 |
| `neo-brutalism` | Neo-Brutalism | A punk rebellion against polished SaaS: raw structure with Pop Art saturation, early-internet sticker culture and zine spirit. | 4169 |
| `neumorphism` | Neumorphism Soft UI | Soft UI: elements look molded from one continuous surface of matte clay, either extruding from it or pressed into it, lit from the top-left. | 2510 |
| `newsprint` | Newsprint | "All the news that's fit to print": the golden age of print journalism made digital. | 3932 |
| `organic` | Organic / Natural | Wabi-sabi made digital: the acceptance of imperfection and transience. | 3485 |
| `playful-geometric` | Playful Geometric | "Stable grid, wild decoration": the Memphis Group cleaned up for modern screens. | 3846 |
| `professional` | Serif | Typographic elegance through classical restraint, like a literary magazine or a premium architecture journal. | 3150 |
| `retro` | Retro / 90s Nostalgia | The early web, unfiltered: GeoCities pages, "Under Construction" banners, hit counters and Windows 95 chrome, crafted as if in 1997. | 4311 |
| `saas` | Minimalist Modern SaaS | Clarity through structure, character through bold detail: high-tech SaaS precision crossed with a creative agency's portfolio. | 4434 |
| `sketch` | Hand-Drawn / Sketch | Authentic imperfection: sketches on paper, sticky notes on a wall, a napkin diagram from a brainstorm. | 3632 |
| `swiss-minimalist` | Swiss International Style | The International Typographic Style of 1950s Switzerland: objective communication, mathematical precision and logical structure. | 3700 |
| `terminal` | Terminal CLI | The command line as a design language: brutally functional, high-contrast and authentically retro, like configuring a server in a clean ZSH or Bash shell (not Matrix rain). | 2945 |
| `vaporwave` | Vaporwave / Outrun | 1980s retro-futurism drenched in neon: perspective grids receding to the horizon, CRT scanlines, a blurred sunset sun and glowing everything, like commanding a vintage terminal in the year 2088. | 4447 |
| `web3` | Bitcoin DeFi / Web3 | Precision engineering, cryptographic trust and digital gold: a cosmic void where data structures glow with Bitcoin-orange warmth, like mining rigs humming in the dark. | 4764 |
