# Wonder harness: extracted design guidelines

Extracted 2026-10-30 from local evidence only (Wonder 0.2.190). These texts are served by Wonder's servers, so they can change without an app update.

| File | Content | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `01-design-fundamentals.md` | Design Fundamentals (Direction, Layout, Spacing, Typography, Color, Contrast, Content) | `get_design_context` results in saved Wonder sessions (`~/.claude/projects/*wonder*`) |
| `02-skills.md` | Full text of the `new-design`, `edit-design`, `design-to-code`, `code-to-design` and `design-library` skills | `get_skills` results in the same sessions |
| `03-persona-and-preferences.md` | The always-on persona rules, design-preference tools and blocks, and agent memory blocks | `~/Library/Application Support/Wonder/agent-text.json` |
| `04-chat-suggestion-style-briefs.md` | 13 sample starter prompts (style briefs, not rules) | same `agent-text.json` |
| `05-design-guidelines-catalog.md` | `get_design_guidelines` and `get_skills` tool definitions (description + input schema), the 31 style slugs, and how a style result is put together | live call through the Wonder app agent, 2026-10-30; schemas from the session's `deferred_tools_record` |
| `06-design-styles/<slug>.md` | Style section of `get_design_guidelines` for each of the 31 styles, verbatim (the live result is the 01 fundamentals + `---` + this section) | same live session |
| `07-skills-remaining.md` | `get_skills` catalog result, plus `generate-assets`, `design-review`, `new-design-references`, `new-design-arrange`, `design-library-icons`, `design-to-code-pull-request` and `code-to-design-library`, verbatim | same live session |

Not included: nothing from `get_design_guidelines` or `get_skills` is missing now. The 5 skills in `02-skills.md` were fetched again live on 2026-10-30 and matched byte for byte. Other Wonder MCP tools (for example `get_design_context`) are only covered as far as saved sessions show them.
