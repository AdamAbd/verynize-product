| Integration failure | Generation test explicitly chooses Custom endpoint before its adapter fields. Both generation and settings flows pass without relaxed assertions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| H1                  | Unknown provider IDs and invalid custom settings recover to defaults. Corrupt JSON is copied to image-provider.json.bak. Writes still validate new settings strictly. Tests cover recovery, get/set and subsequent generation.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| H2                  | Gemini skips thought parts and chooses the last inline image. Regression includes multiple images and a trailing thought image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| M1                  | Reject unsupported targets and invalid parents before generation; image targets replace src; new images use content bounds + 40px or explicit x/y/parent. Provider schema enumerates the catalog. Integration tests cover these paths.                                                                                                                                                         |
| M2                  | Tool description explicitly states the cost. Main-process service limits MCP to five attempts per rolling hour, shared across clients, for the current application process. Preference approval is implemented in agent-runtime-specific paths, not a reusable bridge approval API; the audit's rate-limit fallback therefore also protects external MCP clients. The sixth attempt is tested. |
| M3                  | Custom default is gpt-image-2; legacy api.openai.com gpt-image-1/dall-e records select openai_gpt_image_2. Custom-host keys are never migrated to the OpenAI key slot merely because custom settings were invalid.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| M4                  | Finder consumes useDesign's shared snapshot; no second document clone or JSON stringify. Active result ID survives edits and reopening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| M5                  | Both settings and generation dialog trim pasted keys. Settings displays the IPC error message. Tests cover surrounding whitespace and invalid embedded whitespace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| M6                  | Built-in Gemini uses /v1beta, confirmed against Context7's vendor documentation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| M7                  | Decoded images and binary downloads are capped at 8,000,000 bytes. JSON envelope allows base64 overhead. Oversize regression passes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| L5                  | Only photographic generation opts into selected-layer fills; vector generation inserts a layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| L6                  | Abort controllers are keyed by caller; window close cancels only that window. Concurrent caller regression passes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| L7                  | Test endpoint overrides are ignored when app.isPackaged is true.

Also repaired missing generateImage callback storage in setBridgeOptions, so the desktop bridge actually reaches the generation service.

Formatted only changed files, preserving staging formatting in the six L12 files to avoid recreating the churn. Provider tests use fixtures, not paid vendor calls.
