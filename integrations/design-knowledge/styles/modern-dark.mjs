Almost everything is a shade of charcoal; hierarchy comes from how much light a surface catches, from hairline edges that read as bevels, and from type that fades from bright to dim as it descends. Indigo is the only saturated color and it is spent on actions and focus. The mood is focused and cinematic but never moody or neon.',
