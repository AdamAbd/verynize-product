  identity: 'Everything appears moulded from the same soft material. Elements either swell out of the surface or are pressed into it, and those two states are drawn purely with paired light and dark shadows. Color is nearly absent; a single violet marks the primary action. The result is quiet, physical and pleasant to touch, best for small focused interfaces rather than dense content.',
