  summary: 'An old college reading room on screen: walnut panels, parchment type, brass fittings and measured classical ornament.',
  keywords: ['academia', 'classical', 'scholarly', 'library', 'university', 'museum', 'archive', 'literary', 'heritage', 'antique', 'dark academia', 'manuscript'],
  scene: 'A reading room after hours: walnut shelving, a green-shaded lamp, brass rails and the oxblood spine of a rare folio.',
  identity: 'A complete environment rather than a dark theme with a serif swapped in. Everything is warm brown, cream and old metal; there is no pure black, pure white or cool hue anywhere. Classical book typography carries the voice, brass marks every interactive thing, and ornament is rationed so the page feels learned rather than costume-like. Quiet, warm and serious, at a medium volume.',
