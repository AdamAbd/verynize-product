  identity: 'Form follows function, and function is built from three shapes. Every element is a circle, a square or a triangle, outlined in heavy ink and filled with a flat primary. Whole sections take one primary as their background, which is the most recognisable move. Asymmetric, architectural and confident — loud, but never decorative for its own sake.',
